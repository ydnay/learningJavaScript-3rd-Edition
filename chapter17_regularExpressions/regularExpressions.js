// Regular Expressions

// Regular expressions provide sophisticated string matching functionality. If you want
// to match things that “look like” an email address or a URL or a phone number, regular
// expressions are your friends. A natural complement to string matching is string
// replacement, and regular expressions support that as well—for example, if you want
// to match things that look like email addresses and replace them with a hyperlink for
// that email address.
