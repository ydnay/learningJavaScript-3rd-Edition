// Conclusion

// While this chapter has touched on the major points of regexes, it only scratches the
// surface of the techniques, examples, and complexities inherent in regexes. Becoming
// proficient at regexes is about 20% understanding the theory, and 80% practice. Using
// a robust regex tester (such as regular expressions 101) can be very helpful when
// you’re starting out (and even when you’re experienced!). The most important thing
// you can take away from this chapter is an understanding of how a regex engine consumes
// input; a lack of understanding in that area is the source of a lot of frustration.
