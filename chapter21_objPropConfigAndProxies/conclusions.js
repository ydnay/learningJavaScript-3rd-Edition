// Conclusion

// In this chapter, we’ve pulled back the curtain that hides JavaScript’s object mechanism
// and gotten a detailed picture of how object properties work, and how we can reconfigure
// that behavior. We also learned how to protect objects from modification.
// Lastly, we learned about an extremely useful new concept in ES6: proxies. Proxies
// allow powerful metaprogramming techniques, and I suspect we will be seeing some
// very interesting uses for proxies as ES6 gains popularity.
