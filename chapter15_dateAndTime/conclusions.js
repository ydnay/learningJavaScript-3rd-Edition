// Conclusion

// If you take away three things from this chapter, they should be the following:
// • Internally, dates are represented as the number of milliseconds from the Unix
// Epoch (Jan 1, 1970 UTC).
// • Be aware of the time zone when you’re constructing dates.
// • If you want sophisticated date formatting, consider Moment.js.

// In most real-world applications, it’s hard to get away from date processing and
// manipulation. Hopefully this chapter has given you a foundation in the important
// concepts. The Mozilla Developer Network and Moment.js documentation serve as a
// thorough and detailed reference.
